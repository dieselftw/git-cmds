Git commands are kinda garbage so I made my own. I'll be adding more of these as I see fit.
Only for Unix based operating systems

## General installation instructions

1. Fork and clone.
2. `cd better-git-commands` (Ideally, clone this in a place that you won't be touching too often, like config files)
3. Modify the shell scripts to suit your usecase (follow instructions in the comments)
4. Run `chmod +x *`.

## Available commands

1. `git c` : `git clone` with repo size and general metadata added.
2. `git cmt`: `git commit` but with profiles
